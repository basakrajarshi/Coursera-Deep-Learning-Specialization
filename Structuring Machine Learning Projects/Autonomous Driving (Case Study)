1. To help you practice strategies for machine learning, this week we’ll present another scenario and ask how you would act. We think this “simulator” of working in a machine learning project will give you an idea of what leading a machine learning project could be like!

You are employed by a startup building self-driving cars. You are in charge of detecting road signs (stop sign, pedestrian crossing sign, construction ahead sign) and traffic signals (red and green lights) in images. The goal is to recognize which of these objects appear in each image. As an example, this image contains a pedestrian crossing sign and red traffic lights.


Your 100,000 labeled images are taken using the front-facing camera of your car. This is also the distribution of data you care most about doing well on. You think you might be able to get a much larger dataset off the internet, which could be helpful for training even if the distribution of internet data is not the same. 

Suppose that you came from working with a project for human detection in city parks, so you know that detecting humans in diverse environments can be a difficult problem. What is the first thing you do? Assume each of the steps below would take about an equal amount of time (a few days).
